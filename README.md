## PAC-MAN 256 Decompression Patch

### Installing:
1. Download the Patch [Here (PC)](https://github.com/Cracko298/BattleIslands-Cheat/raw/refs/heads/main/BattleIslands_MoneyPatch_PC.xdelta) and the [Delta Patcher](https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases/latest) for your System.
2. Extract the Delta Patcher, run the Patcher executable.
3. Select the `*.xdelta` patch you downloaded, and apply it to your Unmodified `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file.
   - `BISTEAM_ROOT\BattleIslands_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll` **NOT** `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll`.
4. That's about it, it should work perfectly fine now, and you'll never lose money in-game.
